# Service Provider with AWS PrivateLink

This project demonstrates the implementation of **AWS PrivateLink** to securely connect services across different VPCs without exposing them to the public internet. By leveraging AWS PrivateLink, we enhance the security and availability of the service provider while maintaining seamless connectivity for clients.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created a service provider VPC that exposes services via AWS PrivateLink, allowing clients in other VPCs or AWS accounts to securely access the services without traversing the public internet. This project is designed to simulate a scenario where the service provider is hosting critical services that must be securely consumed by various clients.

### Key AWS Services Used

- **VPC**: Isolated network environments for the service provider and the client.
- **PrivateLink**: Securely connects services across different VPCs using VPC Endpoints.
- **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: Ensures high availability and scalability for the service exposed by the provider.
- **EC2 Instances**: Hosts the application in the service provider VPC.
- **VPC Endpoints**: Enables clients to access the service without traversing the public internet.

### Architecture

The architecture of this project includes the following components:
1. **Service Provider VPC**: Contains the application hosted on EC2 instances behind a Network Load Balancer.
2. **VPC Endpoint**: Configured in the client VPC to privately connect to the service provider’s Network Load Balancer.
3. **PrivateLink**: Ensures secure, low-latency access from the client VPC to the service provider’s application.
4. **Security Groups**: Applied to both the service provider and client resources to ensure secure communication.

### Benefits of AWS PrivateLink

- **Security**: No need for public IPs, keeping traffic within the AWS network.
- **Ease of Access**: Clients can access services in other VPCs without complex routing setups.
- **Reduced Latency**: Direct connections within the AWS infrastructure ensure lower latencies.

## Setup and Deployment

To replicate this project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Service Provider VPC**: Set up a VPC that will host the service.
2. **Deploy an EC2 Instance**: Install and run the application on an EC2 instance within the provider VPC.
3. **Configure a Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: Ensure the NLB can route traffic to the EC2 instance.
4. **Create a VPC Endpoint**: In the client VPC, configure a VPC endpoint to establish a PrivateLink to the service provider’s NLB.
5. **Apply Security Groups**: Properly configure security groups to allow traffic between the provider and client VPCs.
6. **Test the Connection**: Verify that the client can securely access the service via PrivateLink.

## Skills and Learnings

Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

- Configuring AWS PrivateLink to securely expose services to clients in other VPCs.
- Setting up a highly available, scalable service using Network Load Balancers.
- Managing VPC endpoints and security groups to control access to private services.
- Ensuring secure and seamless cross-VPC communication without exposing services to the public internet.
